# ðŸŒ® Foodie Yelp API
A iOS app that lets you create a profile with your name, image, location, and favorite food. Everything is saved in firebase. The app communicates with Yelp, using it's API we gather data
and display the information based off what we chose when we first set up our profile(favorite food, city, etc). 

# Technologies

- Swift
- Firebase
- Xcode
- Yelp API
- Google Authentication

# Why this app?
Foodie helps you choose food places at random. Not only that, but we want to point out the important neighboorhoods in each city. Each neighborhood is unique, so we want to to highlight its 
culture. In doing so, the people from the neighborhood get to show off the food. We are able to save favorites, places we've visited, along with followers, and people you are following. You 
can also see others peoples favorite places and places they've visited. 

# What can we improve?
I'm going to add a top ten in the future based off each city. That way people can see what others are liking, and you can try out. Also maybe a place where you can review, and link socials.
Possibly a counter to, see how many times that place has been visited or favorited.
